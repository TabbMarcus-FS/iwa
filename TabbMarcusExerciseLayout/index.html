            <strong>Gears of War</strong> (also referred to as Gears) is a media
            franchise centered on a series of video games created by Epic Games,
            developed and managed by The Coalition, and owned and published by
            Xbox Game Studios. The franchise is best known for its third-person
            shooter video games, which has been supplemented by spin-off video
            game titles, a DC comic book series, eight novels, a board game
            adaptation and various merchandise.

          <p>
            <strong>The Gears of War</strong> series takes place on Sera,
            <em>a fictional Earth-like</em>
            planet. Human civilization develops and endures a millennia-long
            conflict that leaves humanity on the brink of extinction. Sera's
            leaders broker an era of peace that ushers scientific advancements
            and a cultural renaissance. Humanity's population sporadically grows
            and demands more energy provided by fossil fuel and nuclear power.
            Sera's scientists discover Imulsion, a naturally occurring substance
            that can be refined into a potent energy source. Imulsion solves
            Sera's energy crisis but ultimately creates great economic disparity
            as nations with direct access to Imulsion prosper, while other
            nations fall into financial turmoil.Sera's citizens balkanize into
            two warring factions: the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) and
            Union of Independent Republics (UIR). The ensuing 79-year strife,
            known as the Pendulum Wars, consumes millions of lives with both
            sides locked in a virtual stalemate. The UIR develops the 'Hammer of
            Dawn', a system of satellites capable of delivering precise and
            destructive orbital-to-surface laser strikes. A contingent of COG
            commandos, led by Marcus Fenix, Dominic Santiago, and Victor Hoffman
            launch a daring raid on a UIR stronghold to steal the schematics for
            the Hammer of Dawn. The UIR surrenders after witnessing the Hammer
            of Dawn (completed by Marcus Fenix's father, Professor Adam Fenix)
            devastate one of their naval vessels. Six weeks after the COG and
            UIR agreed to an armistice, a race of subterranean creatures known
            as the Locust Horde emerge from Sera's depths and begin assaulting
            human cities, wiping out 25% of the world population in the first 26
            hours, referred to as 'Emergence Day'. The Locust overwhelm the
            already battle-worn COG forces during this surprise attack, causing
            them to retreat to the Jacinto Plateau, where the Locust cannot dig
            through its granite bedrock, and reluctantly bombard their own
            cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust's advance. The
            ensuing scorched earth tactic destroys much of Sera's cities and
            human population. The COG continues to operate out of the COG
            capital of Ephyra and other cities on the plateau, such as Jacinto.
            The surviving humans outside the plateau and COG jurisdiction, known
            as Stranded, are left to wander through Sera's charred ruins.The
            Locust reemerge and begin a campaign of occupying human cities on
            the Jacinto Plateau to act as stepping stones. The Locust are
            eventually able to emerge and overrun Ephyra 10 years after
            Emergence Day. During the chaos, Marcus Fenix leads an unauthorized
            rescue mission to save his father from the Locust assault. During
            the evacuation, a helicopter is shot down by the Locust and crashes
            into the Fenix Estate, presumably killing Adam. The COG's leadership
            court martials Marcus and sentences him to 40 years in prison. After
            losing Ephyra, the remainder of the COG retreats to Jacinto City.
            Gears of War is set 14 years after the Locust emerged, and four
            years into Marcus Fenix's imprisonment. The COG forces devise a
            last-ditch offensive to destroy the Locust by detonating the
            Lightmass Bomb in their tunnels. Marcus is reinstated into the COG
            army to supplement their depleted ranks and joins Dominic Santiago
            in Delta Squad on a mission to map the Locust tunnel network in
            preparation for the bombing. Their unit is ambushed by Locust forces
            and sustain heavy casualties. Fenix is repromoted to Sergeant and
            leads Delta with two other soldiers, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird.
            While the Sonic Resonator fails to map the tunnels, Delta uncovers
            mapping data already created by Adam Fenix. Marcus retrieves the
            tunnel data from his father's lab, who had been studying the Locust,
            and successfully deploys the Lightmass Bomb. Many of the Locust are
            killed. The Locust Queen, Myrrah, pledges to continue the war
            effort.
          </p>

          <h3>Gears of War 2</h3>
          Gears of War 2 is set six months after the Lightmass Offensive. COG
          soldiers, including Delta, are deployed into the Hollow and battle the
          Locust to stop their plans of sinking Jacinto. The COG discovers the
          Locust have been using a gargantuan worm to sink the cities. After
          killing the Riftworm, Delta is ordered to locate the Locust stronghold
          by accessing intel from New Hope, a decommissioned COG research
          facility. The lab contains genetically altered humans called Sires,
          experiments on children ill with Rustlung that led to the creation of
          the Locust. Files there reveal the New Hope scientists fled to Mount
          Kadar to continue their work in solitude after the COG shut them down.
          The COG attacks Mount Kadar, where the Locust established their
          capital of Nexus. As the COG invades Nexus, they learn the Locust are
          mutating into the "Lambent", organisms infected with Imulsion. They
          have been forcing the Locust out of the Hollow for the surface world.
          Acting on advice from Adam Fenix, Queen Myrrah intends to sink Jacinto
          and use the surrounding seawater to flood the Hollow, drowning the
          Lambent and denying the humans their last safe city. The COG
          intentionally sinks Jacinto before the Locust can evacuate, drowning
          them in their tunnels and destroying their civilization. Adam Fenix is
          revealed to be alive through a radio transmission.

          <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            Gears of War is a third-person shooter game, with its core concepts
            being derived from Resident Evil 4's "over the shoulder"
            perspective, Kill Switch's cover system, and Bionic Commando's
            swinging action akin to moving between points of cover.[13] The
            series focuses on using cover to tactically engage the enemy in
            battle to avoid taking damage. While behind cover, the player can
            fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent, or can look around
            the cover and aim carefully, though exposing to enemy fire; the
            player can slide along cover, move between nearby cover, or vault
            over cover to race to a new point of cover. As the player takes
            damage, the "Crimson Omen" appears on the HUD, becoming more defined
            as the player nears low health levels. The player can regenerate
            their health by staying out of harm's way for a short while. Should
            the player take too much damage, they will become incapacitated
            unless revived by a teammate; depending on game mode, the player may
            be able to recover from this state on their own, or may die after a
            short amount of time if not revived. When a combatant is down, a
            member of the other side may attempt to execute the downed player
            via a "curb stomp" or other brutal methods. Some types of damage
            will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival, such as
            explosive damage. There are five levels on the first two games; they
            are referred to as "acts" and each act is formed into a certain
            number of chapters. Players in Gears of War can carry four different
            weapons, with the exception of the fourth game, allowing two primary
            weapon slots that can carry weapons which include, but are not
            limited to: assault rifles, shotguns, a sniper rifle, grenade
            launchers and an explosive bow; one grenade slot, which may be
            filled with up to four grenades of a specific type (Fragmentation,
            Smoke, Ink and Incendiary), and one pistol-type weapon. Players can
            either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon
            dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various
            maps. Most weapons feature the "Active Reload" ability: either after
            a weapon has depleted an ammo magazine or when the player starts a
            manual reload, a meter is shown on screen, and the player can
            attempt to stop the meter in a certain marked area. If the player
            stops the meter in the marked area, their reload will be completed
            faster than if they did not attempt an Active Reload, and if the
            player can stop the meter at a specific section of the marked area,
            they will gain a temporary slight damage boost with each reloaded
            shot and a faster reload. If the player stops the meter outside this
            area, their gun will become temporarily jammed and slow down the
            reload time. While most of the weapons are based on standard shooter
            archetypes, Gears of War's signature weapon is the Lancer Assault
            Rifle, which has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can be used in
            close quarter combat to instantly kill a standard foe. Another
            notable weapon is the Gnasher Shotgun, which is one of the most-used
            weapons in multiplayer modes for the series, as well as its most
            divisive.[14] While it is inefficient at long distances, it is a
            popular weapon of choice at close-quarters as it is small and easy
            to aim, making it exceptionally useful for close-range combat.[15]
            The Gnasher Shotgun, like many other weapons, can be used to bash
            opponents in melee, or in the case of grenades, can be stuck to a
            foe, exploding a few seconds later. In Gears of War 2 and Gears of
            War 3, all four types of grenades can be planted on any reachable
            surface, detonating when an opponent comes close to it. If the
            opponent spots the grenade, they can detonate it from a safe
            distance by shooting it. All Gears of War games feature a campaign
            mode that can be played cooperatively with one other player. The two
            players take the roles of two COG soldiers, Marcus Fenix and Dominic
            "Dom" Santiago, as they fight the Locust. In the third game the
            campaign allows for up to four players to play together at the same
            time. The campaign mode features several levels of difficulty. At
            various times, the campaign will offer a choice of paths the first
            player can select; if the second player is present, they will be
            forced to take the other path. The third and fourth players in Gears
            of War 3 will be separated between the paths of the first and second
            players. In these areas, all players generally have to work together
            to get them through the section, such as by one player providing
            covering fire while the second player opens a switch that allows the
            first player to proceed. The competitive multiplayer mode in Gears
            of War features 8 players while in Gears of War 2 features up to ten
            players split between COG and Locust forces in a number of gameplay
            types. Modes include "Warzone" and "Execution", both similar to a
            typical deathmatch, and "Annex" and "King of the Hill" where teams
            have to control a marked zone on the map. In the mode "Guardian"
            (only in Gears of War 2) one member of each team is designated as
            the leader. As long as the leader is still alive, their teammates
            can respawn indefinitely. As soon as the leader is executed, their
            teammates can no longer respawn.

          <p>
            In March 2007, New Line Cinema had purchased the rights to make a
            Gears of War film, with Stuart Beattie writing the script along with
            Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey, who would be producing it.[53]
            Producer Wyck Godfrey said of the film adaptation: "I'm not a gamer,
            but what blew me away about Gears was how it captures the mythology
            of a war mission and how high the stakes are."[54] Len Wiseman was
            reported to direct the movie adaptation of Gears of War in
            August,[55] but Godfrey stated that they have "a director we're
            about to attach" in order to film the movie during 2009 and release
            in 2010. Cliff Bleszinski, the lead designer of the Gears of War
            video games, would serve as executive producer and consultant.[56]
            Wiseman signed on in June 2008, with Chris Morgan performing script
            rewrites.[56] Morgan hinted on G4's televised coverage of Comic Con
            2008 that the film would be a prequel to the first game, "it could
            explain how Marcus Fenix got his scar".[57] According to Morgan,
            Wiseman "wants to make it as realistic as possible, and to blur
            those lines where your mind says, 'Oh, it's a big CGI film.'".[58]
            Wyck Godfrey said in December 2009 that the intention of the Gears
            of War film was "to tell the epic story of an alien planet that's
            living in a horrific environment just feels like the wrong mood
            right now".[59] In April 2010, New Line considerably scaled back the
            $100 million budget and story, stalling progress while they waited
            for a rewrite. Len Wiseman was no longer involved as he shifted his
            focus to other projects. In April 2013, Variety reported that
            "Creative Artists Agency is eager to meet with producers in the
            coming weeks and set up the project elsewhere" and that Stuart
            Beattie would write the film.[61] Scott Stuber is named to produce
            the film.[62] At the launch ceremony for Gears of War 4 in October
            2016, The Coalition's Rod Fergusson affirmed that a Gears of War
            movie entered development for a theatrical release at Universal
            Pictures. Scott Stuber and Dylan Clark would produce the film under
            Universal's Bluegrass Films division, but no director or writer has
            been selected at this point. Fergusson also stated that where the
            film takes place relative to the games has been determined.[63]
            Universal hired Shane Salerno to write the screenplay with Fergusson
            in May 2017, saying that "the movie won't be based on one of the
            games but a new story set in the universe."[64] F. Scott Frazier was
            reported to write the film's script the following year.[65] The film
            adaptation will not be set in the same universe as the video
            games.[66] In November 2022, the film entered development for
            streaming on Netflix, who will collaborate with The Coalition on the
            film.[67] On May 15, 2025, The Hollywood Reporter announced that
            David Leitch will direct and co-produce the movie.
